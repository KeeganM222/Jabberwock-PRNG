Hello world,

This is a test of the Jabberwock PRNG's one-time-pad program.

A very simple cryptosystem relying on randomness in single-use keys.

This cryptosystem is not a true one-time-pad since the data output from the Jabberwock PRNG is not truly random, but the better the pseudo-random source, the closer to perfect information security the cryptosystem becomes.
